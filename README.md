## Overview 
The following project is a school display that displays the weather, snow day predictor, school news, school tweets, as well as the world news. This project scrapes raw information from the websites. This can result in slower performance or simply returning the wrong tags. It is recommended that when possible use proper APIs.

## Websites üîó
The following websites are being scrapped:
* [CBC Weather](https://www.cbc.ca/weather/s0000430.html)
* [Snow Day Calculator](https://www.snowdaycalculator.com/calculator.php)
* [OSTA](http://www.ottawaschoolbus.ca/)
* School Website (OCDSB)
* [BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/world)

## Other Notes üìù
If you decide to use this there are a couple things you will have to change:
* Some of the titles & logos based on the school
* Twitter API
  - Twitter Username
  - Twitter API keys
* CBC weather location
* School website
